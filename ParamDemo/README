A demo program to show a range of in, inout, and out parameters in Java/IDL.

To run this demo:

1. Translate the IDL

	idlj -fall ParamTest.idl


2. Compile the sources

	javac *.java ParamTest/*.java


3. Start the server

	java ParamTestServer

 

4. In another window ....
... Having cd'd to the right (same) directory ...
... Start the client

	java ParamTestClient


The Client output will look something like:

	addNums 5 and 6 gives: 11.0
	String array contains: 
		0: hi_there
		1: hi_there
		2: hi_there
		3: hi_there
		4: hi_there
	Struct contains: hallo 4711
	Array size: 5
	op5 done. out: 1234567890
	string_cube after operation: 
	Returned element [0][0][0]
	Returned element [0][0][1]
	Returned element [0][0][2]
	Returned element [0][1][0]
	Returned element [0][1][1]
	Returned element [0][1][2]
	---Everything went alright, closing down now---


Note that there will be output on the Server window as well.

Study the code and make sure you understand what is going on.
