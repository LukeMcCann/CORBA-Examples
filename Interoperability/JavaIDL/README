This is the JavaIDL half of the Java/Python interoperability demo.


To use this part of the demo:

1. compile the IDL:

	idlj -fall HelloWorld.idl


2. Compile server client and stubs and skeletons:

	javac *.java HelloWorld/*.java


3. Start server:

	java HelloServer


4. Start client in another command tool:

	java HelloClient


5.  See the Python/Fnorb demo.  Follow the instructions in the README to
get that working, then copy the "server.ref" files around to get the Java
client calling the Python server, and vice-versa.


Remember to kill the server when you have finished with it by pressing ctrl-c.
