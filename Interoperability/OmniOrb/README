This is the Python half of the Java/Python interoperability demo.  It
uses the OmniOrb open source python (and C++) orb.


To use this part of the demo:

1. Compile the IDL to create the Stub and Skeleton Modules:

	omniidl -bpython HelloWorld.idl


2. Start the Server:

	python server.py


3. Start client in another command tool:

	python client.py


4.  See the JavaIDL demo.  Follow the instructions in the README to
get that working, then copy the "server.ref" files around to get the Python
client calling the Java server, and vice-versa.



Remember to kill the server when you have finished with it by pressing ctrl-c.
