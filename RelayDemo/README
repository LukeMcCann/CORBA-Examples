Demo of a "relay" - i.e. a client and server at the same time (using IOR in file trick)

1. compile IDL

	idlj -fall Relay.idl

2. Compile all stubs and skeletons

	javac *.java ClientAndServer/*.java

3. start server

	java RelayServer

4. in another command tool, start the relay (the client/server in the middle)

        java Relay

5. in another command tool, start the client

	java RelayClient

which will produce output similar to the following:

Hello world !!
